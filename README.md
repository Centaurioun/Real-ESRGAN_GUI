# Real-ESRGAN_GUI
A C# GUI implementation of [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN). This implementation relys on a custom version of [NcnnDotNet](https://github.com/net2cn/NcnnDotNet).

Note that this is still working in progress. Current output image is still a complete mess (but with recognizable features from the input image).

PRs are welcomed.
